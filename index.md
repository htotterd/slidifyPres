# Why use this application?
- In most middle and high school classrooms, subjects are taught separately
and rarely are integrated together.
- As a way to combine both statistics and biology, this applet simulates a
zombie apocalypse as an allegory for an infectious disease.
- This applet runs a simulation to estimate the number of days until a
population has completely become zombies or dead.

---
# Applet Inputs
-  This applet takes in 3 inputs:
  * Population Size - The initial number of both humans and zombies at the
  beginning of Day 1.
  * Probability of Zombie Bite - The probability of being bit by a zombie on
  any given day.
  * Probability of Death from a Zombie Bite (as opposed to becoming a Zombie)

# Applet output

<img src="Plot.PNG" alt="Population Statistics" align="center">

The applet will output the daily population proportions of zombies and humans
and graph them on a line chart.

---
# Future additions to this applet

- An intervention (such as a treatment for an infectious disease) to eliminate zombies.
  * The simulation will then end when there are either no zombies or no alive humans.
- Running the simulation for some large number of times to figure out the average time it would take for the human population to be eradicated during a zombie apocalypse with no intervention treatment.
